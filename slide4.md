## Setup Terraform for Vault

Install Vault and Terraform and create a Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf).  
Configure the Vault provider and AWS secrets engine.  

```hcl
provider "vault" {
  address = "http://localhost:8200"
  token   = "your_vault_token"
}
resource "vault_mount" "aws" {
  path = "aws"
  type = "aws"
}
resource "vault_aws_secret_backend_role" "example_role" {
  backend = vault_mount.aws.path
  name    = "example_role"
  policy  = file("aws_policy.json")
}
```

???

 "To get started, you'll need to install both Vault and Terraform on your machine or server."
Next, you'll create a configuration file in Terraform that specifies the provider and resources you want to manage."
In the configuration file, you'll specify the Vault provider and create resources, such as the AWS secrets engine, that allow you to interact with Vault."
